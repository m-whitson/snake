I want to create a snake game similar to http://www.menet.umn.edu/~dockt036/snake.html
to practice MVC design. Hopefully I can make it into a playable JAR. The game above has a link
to the source code in JavaScript, so maybe I'll compare it with my design when I'm done.

7/16: Beginning to construct the model. A model has a Snake, which is made up of Cells.
